# Data Scientist 
This is my data science portfolio. I am a Data Science Fellow with hands-on training from The Knowledge House Innovation Fellowship, focused on Python programming, SQL, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. Experienced in relational databases, data wrangling with pandas, and predictive analytics. Awarded 1st place in the Bloomberg Hackathon for developing a prototype for a community application under pressure. Passionate about applying data science to biomedical research, healthcare operations, and life sciences innovation.

### Coffee-Production-Predictor                  May 2025 
- Analyzed 10+ years of weather and crop yield data from Brazil to model environmental impacts on coffee production. 
- Merged two datasets (~20K rows) to explore correlations between rainfall, temperature, humidity, and crop output. 
- Conducted exploratory data analysis in Python (Pandas, Seaborn) to identify key predictors of yield variation.
- Discovered a strong positive correlation (R=0.92) between average wind speed and coffee output. 
- Proposed future variables for model improvement, including pest outbreaks, deforestation rates, and commodity pricing. 

### OpenAI.SentimentSorter                      April 2025 
- Built a sentiment analysis pipeline using OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini API to classify 1,000+ product reviews as positive, neutral, negative, or irrelevant. 
- Engineered input validation and error handling to ensure robust API interactions and prevent invalid submissions. 
- Designed a system prompt with context-aware examples to improve model labeling accuracy across diverse review content. 
- Visualized sentiment distribution using Python to uncover trends in user feedback and product satisfaction. 
- Achieved 100% test pass rate using test-driven development for data ingestion, labeling, and visualization modules. 

### Heart Monitor Analysis                   March 2025 
- Built a Python app to analyze 9,000+ heart rate data points and detect sleep and activity patterns.
- Cleaned and validated raw sensor data, removing all non-numeric and erroneous entries. 
- Coded statistical functions (mean, variance, std. dev.) from scratch using base Python. 
- Visualized heart rate trends with matplotlib to assess sleep quality and exercise periods. 
- Achieved 100% test pass rate using test-driven development across all modules.
